WWW-TheMovieDB-Search version 0.01
===============================

This client lets you retrieve data from the TMDb Search; I currently have not implemented methods to write to the Search, I don't really plan on it, unless someone really wants the feature.

It requires that you have a TMDb Search key, which you can generate by getting an account at: http://api.themoviedb.org/2.1
